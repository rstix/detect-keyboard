How about Joey Peppone?

Oh, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.

Joey, Switzerland.

Plus, I think it should be Joe, you know, Joey makes me sound like um, oh, this big,

Joe, Joe, Joe, Stalin.

Stalin? Stalin. Do I know that name? That sounds familiar.

Well, it does not ring bell with me.

Joe Stalin. You know, that's pretty good.

You might want to try Joseph.

Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that.

Oh yeah. Yes, bye-bye, Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin.

Joseph Stalin is the fiddler on the roof.
