1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,510
How about Joey Paponi?

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,670
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks 
I should have a name that's more neutral.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:15,390
Joey, Switzerland.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,310
Plus, I think it should be Joe, you know, Joey makes me sound like um, oh, this big,

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,190
which I'm not.

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,910
Joe, Joe, Joe, Stalin.

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,590
Stalin? Stalin. Do I know that name? That sounds familiar.

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,350
Well, it does not ring a bell with me.

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,950
Joe Stalin. You know, that's pretty good.

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:55,670
You might want to try Joseph.

11
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,630
Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that.

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,590
Oh yeah. Yes, bye-bye, Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin.

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,550
Joseph Stalin is the fiddler on the roof.
